#The game is a game that requires the player to repeat a pattern that is shown on the screen.

#The game can go on forever, but if you lose a level, points are taken away.

        will score you one point, but every lose, you will lose one. every win on medium will 
        score you one point five points, but every lose will take away one point five. Every win on
